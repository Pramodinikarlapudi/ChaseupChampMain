# ChaseupChamp
All in one environment for students :)

Chaseup Champ is my idea of building a cozy environment for students studying  
Main idea is to provide features that can make students so comfortable    
Everything in one place,  
Features in my mind right now are:  
1. Chat application inclusion -> being able to scan a qr and join a class of friends, chat and discuss stuff
2. Progress tracker -> can link it with the tasks in the to do list section and display the progress
3. Random Motivational Quote generator -> will just be a button on the top nav (we need it right ?)
4. Homework assignments storage : Students will be able to store all their homework/assignment files in one place
5. Personal Space : May be can include a diary where they can express their thoughts without a privacy concern
6. Personal Space can also have their favourite books, some password storage like may be their socials, netflix ?
7. let them make chaseup personal themselves by allowing them to add their favourite wallpapers, animations.
8. Doubt/ issue posting to all the group members

Main Hurdles i feel are:  
1. Storage -> Where will all the data acquired from the students gets stored
2. How the hell will i do all by myself !!!??  
Learning alot recently, let's see ;)
